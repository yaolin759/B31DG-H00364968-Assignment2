This experimental project aims to create a machine monitoring system using FreeRTOS and an ESP32 kit. The system comprises eight tasks, each with strict real-time deadlines, to monitor and control various aspects of the machine. These tasks involve outputting digital signals, measuring signal frequencies, sampling analog inputs, logging frequency information, and controlling LEDs via buttons. The system must ensure stable operation while promptly detecting and handling any anomalies.  

The entire experiment implementation consists of two stages: first, implementing individual tasks, and then adjusting settings to achieve multitasking parallelism. During the implementation of individual tasks, I encountered issues such as hardware contacts not being properly made, resulting in interference with signal output. In the multitasking parallelism phase, I faced watchdog exceptions, which I resolved by adjusting task priorities, understanding task implementation principles, and adjusting stack capacities.  

In this machine monitoring system, the coordination between tasks and the prioritization of tasks are crucial for establishing a comprehensive real-time monitoring and control system. Leveraging the flexibility and robust features of FreeRTOS, multiple tasks can be efficiently managed to ensure timely completion and coordination. This system not only provides real-time monitoring of various machine aspects but also offers a manual control interface for operators to make adjustments and interventions as needed.
